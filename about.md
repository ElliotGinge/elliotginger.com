# About

I work on systems where clarity, reliability, and trust matter.

My focus is on aligning people, process, and data so organisations can make better decisions and deliver change without unnecessary friction. That often means simplifying reporting, improving ownership, and introducing automation in a way teams can understand and rely on.

I’m particularly interested in work that sits between strategy and execution — translating intent into systems that hold up under real operational pressure.

I optimise for:
- clear ownership and accountability
- decision-focused reporting
- sustainable automation
- change that teams actually adopt

This site captures examples of that work, along with notes on what I’ve learned along the way.
