# When Metrics Mean Different Things

Case Study

## Context

In a growing operational environment, multiple teams were reporting on the same metrics — but using subtly different definitions.

Each team’s logic made sense in isolation. Each report was technically correct within its own context. Yet leadership discussions regularly stalled while numbers were reconciled rather than acted upon.

The issue wasn’t data availability.  
It was shared meaning.

## The Problem

Conflicting definitions created quiet friction:

- Teams reported different values for the same metric
- Performance discussions focused on reconciliation rather than decisions
- Trust in reporting began to erode
- Workarounds multiplied across spreadsheets and extracts

No single system was “wrong”.  
The architecture lacked alignment.

## The Approach

Rather than starting with tooling, the focus shifted to structure.

The work centred on:

- Mapping how each team defined key metrics
- Making implicit assumptions explicit
- Identifying where definitions genuinely differed — and why
- Facilitating agreement on which metrics required strict consistency

Not every definition needed to be identical.  
But the boundaries needed to be visible.

Once alignment was reached, reporting structures were simplified to reflect shared definitions, with clear ownership assigned for ongoing governance.

## The Outcome

The impact was disproportionate to the technical change:

- Leadership discussions moved faster, with less debate over numbers
- Trust in reporting improved
- Cross-team friction reduced
- Governance became lighter because expectations were clearer

The change was not driven by new dashboards, but by deliberate alignment.

## Key Takeaways

- Metrics are agreements before they are numbers
- Alignment reduces friction more effectively than tooling
- Governance works best when definitions are explicit
- Trust is built through consistency, not complexity
