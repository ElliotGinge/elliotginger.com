title: Systems & Reporting Alignment
---

## Context

In a growing operational business, reporting and systems had evolved organically over time. Data existed across multiple platforms, with different teams relying on their own extracts, spreadsheets, and definitions to run day-to-day operations.

Leadership needed clearer, more consistent insight to support planning and decision-making — without slowing teams down.

## The Problem

While data was available, it wasn’t reliable or easy to interpret:

- Reporting definitions varied between teams
- Manual processes created delays and errors
- Ownership of data and systems was unclear
- Decision-makers spent more time reconciling numbers than acting on them

The result was friction: slower decisions, duplicated effort, and limited trust in reports.

## The Approach

Rather than starting with tools, I focused on alignment:

- Clarifying what decisions actually needed supporting
- Establishing shared definitions and ownership for core metrics
- Simplifying data flows and reducing manual handling
- Designing reporting structures that reflected how the business operated, not just how systems were built

Stakeholders were involved early, with changes delivered incrementally to avoid disruption.

## The Outcome

The improvements delivered practical, lasting impact:

- Reporting became consistent and trusted across teams
- Manual effort and reconciliation time were significantly reduced
- Decision-makers had clearer, timelier insight
- Teams spent less time firefighting and more time improving processes

Crucially, the approach scaled as the organisation continued to evolve.

## Key Takeaways

- Alignment matters more than tooling
- Clear ownership is essential for trustworthy data
- Incremental delivery builds confidence and adoption
- Systems should reflect how decisions are made, not just how data is stored
