## Context

In a growing operational business, reporting and systems had evolved organically over time. Data existed across multiple platforms, with different teams relying on their own extracts, spreadsheets, and definitions to run day-to-day operations.

Leadership needed clearer, more consistent insight to support planning and decision-making — without slowing teams down.

## The Problem

While data was available, it wasn’t reliable or easy to interpret:

- Reporting definitions varied between teams
- Manual processes created delays and errors
- Ownership of data and systems was unclear
- Decision-makers spent more time reconciling numbers than acting on them

The result was friction: slower decisions, duplicated effort, and limited trust in reports.

## The Approach

Rather than starting with tools, I focused on alignment:

- Clarifying what decisions actually needed supporting
- Establishing shared definitions and ownership for core metrics
- Simplifying data flows and reducing manual handling
- Designing reporting structures that reflected how the business operated, not just how systems were built

Stakeholders were involved early, with changes delivered incrementally to avoid disruption.

## The Outcome

The changes created a more dependable foundation for decision-making:

- Leadership had a consistent view of performance across teams
- Time spent reconciling numbers and questioning reports was reduced
- Reporting became easier to maintain and evolve as needs changed
- Teams were able to focus on improvement rather than explanation

Trust in reporting improved not because it was more complex, but because it was clearer and better owned.


## Key Takeaways

- Shared definitions enable faster decisions
- Ownership is as important as accuracy
- Simplicity scales better than complexity
- Reporting should reflect how the business actually operates
