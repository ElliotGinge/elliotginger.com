# Approach

I design systems that reduce ambiguity and increase decision velocity.

The work is rarely about technology first. It’s about structure: shared definitions, clear ownership, reliable data, and processes that hold up under operational pressure.

## Principles

### 1) Alignment before tooling
Tools amplify whatever already exists, clarity or confusion. I start by aligning on decisions, definitions, and ownership before changing platforms or workflows.

### 2) Ownership before automation
Automation without ownership becomes fragile. Every automated process needs a clear owner, visible boundaries, and safe failure states.

### 3) Metrics are contracts
A metric is an agreement about meaning. If definitions vary between teams, reporting becomes debate not insight.

### 4) Simplicity scales
Complexity feels powerful early and expensive later. I optimise for structures that remain understandable as the organisation changes.

### 5) Control builds trust
Trust comes from visibility, auditability, and predictable behaviour, not speed alone. Guardrails are what make change adoptable.

## Start Here

If you’re new to my work, these are the best entry points:

- [The AI Gold Rush Is Built on Sand](/thinking/ai-gold-rush-built-on-sand/)
- [Automation Doesn’t Start With Tools](/thinking/automation-doesnt-start-with-tools/)
- [Why Most Reporting Fails at the Last Mile](/thinking/why-most-reporting-fails-at-the-last-mile/)

## Evidence in Practice

- **[Systems & Reporting Alignment](/work/systems-and-reporting-alignment/)**  
  Creating shared definitions and ownership so reporting becomes decision-ready.

- **[Automation with Control](/work/automation-with-control/)**  
  Reducing operational effort without introducing fragility or hidden risk.
