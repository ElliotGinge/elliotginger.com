Systems • Data • Automation
</span>

<div style="height:2rem"></div>

I improve business systems and reporting — turning operational complexity into clarity.

<div style="height:1rem"></div>

I work at the intersection of process, platforms, and decision-making: designing data models, automations, and ways of working that hold up under real-world pressure.

## What you’ll find here

- **Work:** outcome-focused case studies and examples — what changed, why it mattered.  
- **Thinking:** short notes on systems, analytics, automation, and practical governance.  
- **About:** how I work and what I optimise for.  

<div style="height:1.5rem"></div>

<span class="muted">Currently evolving — more case studies and notes coming soon.</span>
