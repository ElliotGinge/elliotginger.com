Systems • Data • Automation
</span>

<div style="height:2rem"></div>

I lead and deliver systems improvement — aligning people, process, and data so decisions get easier and delivery gets faster.

<div style="height:1rem"></div>

My work focuses on turning fragmented reporting, manual processes, and unclear ownership into coherent platforms teams can trust.

## What you’ll find here

- **Work** — outcome-focused case studies showing how systems and reporting were improved in practice  
- **Thinking** — short notes on analytics, automation, governance, and change that sticks  
- **About** — how I work, what I optimise for, and the trade-offs I care about

This site is evolving — more case studies and notes are being added.
