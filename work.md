# Work

I focus on systems improvement that holds up in practice — aligning people, process, and data so organisations can make better decisions and execute with confidence.

The case studies below highlight different facets of that work: from creating shared clarity around reporting, to introducing automation in a way teams can trust.

  Establishing shared definitions and ownership to create trusted, decision-ready reporting.

  Reducing manual effort through automation while maintaining visibility, ownership, and trust.
