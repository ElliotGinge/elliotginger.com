# Work

I focus on systems improvement that holds up in practice — aligning people, process, and data so organisations can make better decisions and execute with confidence.

The case studies below highlight different facets of that work: from creating shared clarity around reporting, to introducing automation in a way teams can trust.

## Case studies

- **[Systems & Reporting Alignment](/work/systems-and-reporting-alignment/)**  
  Creating shared definitions, clear ownership, and trusted reporting across teams.

- **[Automation with Control](/work/automation-with-control/)**  
  Introducing automation that reduced effort while maintaining trust and governance.
