# Work

I focus on systems improvement that holds up in practice — aligning people, process, and data so organisations can make better decisions and execute with confidence.

The case studies below highlight different facets of that work: from creating shared clarity around reporting, to introducing automation in a way teams can trust.

## Case studies

- **[Systems & Reporting Alignment](/work/systems-and-reporting-alignment/)**  
  Establishing shared definitions and ownership to create trusted, decision-ready reporting.

- **[Automation with Control](/work/automation-with-control/)**  
  Reducing manual effort through automation while maintaining visibility, ownership, and trust.

- **[The Ginger Arms Ordering System](/work/ginger-arms-ordering-system/)**  
  A small, personal build exploring how simple systems can remove friction in everyday situations.
