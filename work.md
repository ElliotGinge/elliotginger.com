# Work

I design systems that hold up in practice; aligning people, process, and data so organisations can make better decisions and execute with confidence.

## What This Work Focuses On

Most systems don’t fail because of technology.

They fail because alignment, ownership, or clarity break down under pressure.

The case studies below explore how those issues were addressed in practice, through clearer definitions, better reporting design, and automation introduced with control rather than disruption.
