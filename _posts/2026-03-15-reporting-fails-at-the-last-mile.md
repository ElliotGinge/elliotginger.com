title: Why Most Reporting Fails at the Last Mile
tags: [data, reporting, systems]
excerpt: "Reporting rarely fails because the data is wrong. It fails when insight doesn’t translate into decisions. The last mile, from dashboard to action, is where most reporting quietly breaks down."

Most reporting problems don’t begin with data quality.

They begin at the last mile, where information is supposed to influence a decision.

It’s common to see technically sound dashboards that still fail to change behaviour. Not because the numbers are wrong, but because the report doesn’t align with how decisions are actually made.

## Where Things Break Down

Last-mile failures usually look like this:

- Metrics without clear owners  
- Charts without decisions attached  
- Data that updates regularly but isn’t acted on  
- Reports built around availability, not usefulness  

The output exists.

But the purpose is vague.

## Reporting Isn’t the Same as Insight

Insight requires context:

- What decision is this supporting?  
- What action should follow?  
- What happens if the number changes?  

Without that framing, reporting becomes passive.

People look at it, nod, and move on.

## Designing for Decisions

The most effective reporting starts with questions, not data:

- What decision is someone trying to make?  
- What would change their mind?  
- What do they need to trust before acting?  

When those answers are clear, the data requirements often become simpler, not more complex.

Clarity reduces noise.

## Reporting That Works

Good reporting doesn’t get talked about much.

It gets used.

When decisions happen without debate over the numbers, that’s usually a sign the last mile has been designed deliberately.

Because reporting doesn’t succeed when it looks impressive.

It succeeds when it changes behaviour.
