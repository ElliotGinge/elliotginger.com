title: Why Most Reporting Fails at the Last Mile

Most reporting problems don’t start with data quality.

They start at the last mile — where information is supposed to support a decision.

It’s common to see technically sound dashboards that still fail to change behaviour. Not because the numbers are wrong, but because the report doesn’t align with how decisions are actually made.

## Where things break down

Last-mile reporting issues usually look like this:
- metrics without clear owners
- charts without decisions attached
- data that updates regularly but isn’t acted on
- reports built around availability, not usefulness

The output exists, but the purpose is vague.

## Reporting isn’t the same as insight

Insight requires context:
- what decision is this supporting?
- what action should follow?
- what happens if the number changes?

Without that framing, reporting becomes passive. People look at it, nod, and move on.

## Designing for decisions

The most effective reporting I’ve seen starts with questions, not data:
- What decision is someone trying to make?
- What would change their mind?
- What do they need to trust before acting?

When those answers are clear, the data requirements often become simpler, not more complex.

## The quiet measure of success

Good reporting doesn’t get talked about much.

It gets used.

When decisions start happening without debate over numbers, that’s usually a sign the last mile has been designed properly.
